# ShipNoise-PE-Model
A Python-based underwater acoustic modeling tool that identifies high-noise ships, computes SPL convergence, and generates bathymetry profiles for PE model simulations. Integrates ship source levels, bathymetry, and propagation modelling to assess underwater noise impact efficiently.
